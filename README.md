# 2025_windstorm_CI

This github repository stores the python scripts and Jupyter notebooks to recreate the main figures in the CI2025 paper titled "From Winter Storm Thermody-
namics to Wind Gust Extremes: Discovering Interpretable Equations from Data"

To recreate the figures in the main text, you will use the notebooks in the /notebooks/analysis folder: 

Figure 1: Cluster 4 PDFs and the summary plots for the GEV coefficients (GEV_visualization.ipynb), the cluster map (error_maps.ipynb)

Figure 2: Pareto plots for the max RMSE-U winds feature selection methods, with the Pareto front (fig2.ipynb)

Figure 3: Error maps for the mean RMSE-cluster split-U/Z feature selection methods (error_maps.ipynb)

Figure 4: Coefficient maps and the PC eigenvector time series (coeff_maps.ipynb)
